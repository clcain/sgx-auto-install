# SGX Automated Installer

This is a collection of scripts that make installing Intel SGX easier. It has been tested on an Intel NUC running Debian 10.

## Installation

You can choose an individual installation file, or you can install everything with:

```
./install.sh
```

*Note: These scripts assume you want the SGX repositories placed in the parent directory of this repository.*

## Uninstallation

Same as the installation.

```
./uninstall.sh
```
